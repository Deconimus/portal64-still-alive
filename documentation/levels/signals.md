# Level Signals

Signals are a way to indicate that something is happening in a level. They can
be emitted by:
* Level objects
* Triggers
* Cutscenes
* Signal operators

Other parts of the level can listen for signals in order to perform some sort of
action. The possible listeners are:
* Level objects
* Cutscenes

Signal information is output into generated level definition C source files at
level export time by the Lua scripts in `tools/level_scripts/`, initiated by
`export_level.lua`.

The code for sending and receiving signals is in `src/scene/signals.c`. The
engine uses this to wire up the various emitters and listeners.

## Level objects

Level objects which send or receive signals have the relevant signal name as
part of their object name in the level's `.blend` file using the format:
```
@object_type SIGNAL_NAME
```

For example, consider the following object names:
* `@ball_catcher exit_activate`
* `@door exit_activate`

In this example, the ball catcher sets the `exit_activate` signal when
activated. The door listens for that signal, and so it will open when a ball
reaches the ball catcher.

There are various other level objects that can send and receive signals,
including those that the player cannot directly interact with such as the
indicator light strips (they are materials). Some other special cases, such as
buttons, can set multiple signals. The exact name structure differs per object.
See [Level Objects](./level_objects/README.md) for more details.

Objects which can be deactivated will clear their associated signal when that
occurs.

## Triggers

[Triggers](./level_objects/trigger.md) are 3D boxes in a level that set signals
depending on which object type enters them. Like level objects, this information
is defined in their object name in the level's `.blend` file. Trigger object
names are of the form:
```
@trigger PLAYER_CUTSCENE_NAME PLAYER_SIGNAL_NAME CUBE_CUTSCENE_NAME CUBE_SIGNAL_NAME
```
`PLAYER_SIGNAL_NAME` is set/unset when the player enters/leaves the trigger and
`CUBE_SIGNAL_NAME` is set/unset when a cube enters/leaves the trigger.

## Cutscenes

[Cutscenes](./cutscenes/README.md) can set and clear signals using the
`set_signal` and `clear_signal` steps, respectively. For example:
```
set_signal door_activate
[...]
clear_signal door_activate
```

The way this works internally is by altering the default state of the signal. In
the above example, in between `set_signal` and `clear_signal`, other signal
emitters such as buttons would clear the signal when activated.

Cutscenes can also wait for a particular signal to occur using the
`wait_for_signal` step. A number of frames the signal must be set for can
optionally be specified. For example:
```
[...]
wait_for_signal player_in_trigger
clear_signal door_activate
[...]
wait_for_signal player_in_trigger 42
clear_signal door_activate
[...]
```

## Signal operators

Level definition YAML files can optionally contain an array property named
`operators`. Each array entry must be an equation matching one of the following
forms:
```
signal_name = not other_signal_name
signal_name = signal_a or signal_b
signal_name = signal_c and signal_d
```

Only one `not`, `or`, or `and` operator is allowed per entry. If more complex
combinations are required, operators can use signals defined by previous
operators. For example:
```yaml
operators:
  - door_not_activated = not door_activated
  - cube_not_in_room = not cube_in_room
  - trapped = door_not_activated and cube_not_in_room
```

Operators are evaluated from top to bottom to update their corresponding
signals. Signals from any source can be used.
